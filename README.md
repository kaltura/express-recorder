# Kaltura Express Recorder
Kaltura Express Recorder (aka Express Capture or kSelfie) enables recording videos directly from the browser without the need to install additional software. 
Web recorder is based on <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> and its predecessor project - <a href="https://github.com/kaltura/webrtc-krecord">webrtc-krecord</a>.<br />

Officially supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera.

## Dev install
1. git clone
2. npm install

(assuming this failed running because node-sass issues, try npm ci instead)

## IMPORTANT NOTE!
If npm install fails make sure you are using node 14 (node-sass is dependant on it). You can download nvm and use it to set the node engine to be the proper one 'nvm use 14'

## Run the project
clone index.template.ejs into index.ejs (Same dir) and fill in the needed properties.

execute - "npm run serve"

## Run with storybook
1. fill props in expressRecorder.stories.jsx </br>
2. yarn run storybook

## Create build release
1. update the package.json file with the new version
2. npm run build
3. copy files located under 'dist' folder to your project, or use the zip file with the version name.
4. attach the zip created (on the root of the project) to the release notes.

## Embedding into html page
`const component = Kaltura.ExpressRecorder.create('parent_div_id', {
       list of props for expressRecorder components in form of 'prop': 'value'
   });`

## deployment to Kaltura server
